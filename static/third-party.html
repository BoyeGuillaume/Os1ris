        UBUNTU FONT LICENCE Version 1.0
    </blockquote>
    
    <h5>PREAMBLE</h5>
    <p>
        This licence allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
        redistributed freely. The fonts, including any derivative works, can be
        bundled, embedded, and redistributed provided the terms of this licence
        are met. The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released under
        any other licence. The requirement for fonts to remain under this
        licence does not require any document created using the fonts or their
        derivatives to be published under this licence, as long as the primary
        purpose of the document is not to be a vehicle for the distribution of
        the fonts.
    </p>

    <h5>DEFINITIONS</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>
            "Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
            Holder(s) under this licence and clearly marked as such. This may
            include source files, build scripts and documentation.
        </li>
        <li>
            "Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components
            as received under this licence.
        </li>
        <li>
            "Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
            or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
            Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to
            a new environment.
        </li>
        <li>
            "Copyright Holder(s)" refers to all individuals and companies who have a
            copyright ownership of the Font Software.
        </li>
        <li>
            "Substantially Changed" refers to Modified Versions which can be easily
            identified as dissimilar to the Font Software by users of the Font
            Software comparing the Original Version with the Modified Version.
        </li>
        <li>
            To "Propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
            permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
            infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
            computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,
            distribution (with or without modification and with or without charging
            a redistribution fee), making available to the public, and in some
            countries other activities as well.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h5>PERMISSION & CONDITIONS</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Each copy of the Font Software must contain the above copyright
            notice and this licence. These can be included either as stand-alone
            text files, human-readable headers or in the appropriate machine-
            readable metadata fields within text or binary files as long as those
            fields can be easily viewed by the user.
        </li>
        <li>
            The font name complies with the following:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    The Original Version must retain its name, unmodified.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Modified Versions which are Substantially Changed must be renamed to
                    avoid use of the name of the Original Version or similar names entirely.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Modified Versions which are not Substantially Changed must be
                    renamed to both
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            retain the name of the Original Version and
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            add additional naming elements to distinguish the Modified Version from the
                            Original Version.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    The name of such Modified Versions must be the name of
                    the Original Version, with "derivative X" where X represents the name of
                    the new work, appended to that name.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) and any contributor to the
            Font Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
            Modified Version, except 
            <ol>
                <li>as required by this licence,</li>
                <li>to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or</li>
                <li>with their explicit written permission.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole, must
            be distributed entirely under this licence, and must not be distributed
            under any other licence. The requirement for fonts to remain under this
            licence does not affect any document created using the Font Software,
            except any version of the Font Software extracted from a document
            created using the Font Software may only be distributed under this
            licence.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h5>TERMINATION</h5>
    <p>
        This licence becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are
        not met.
    </p>

    <h5>DISCLAIMER</h5>
    <p>
